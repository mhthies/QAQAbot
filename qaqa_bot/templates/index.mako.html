    The sheet is passed on to the next player, the task of whom is to find a question that is answered by the given answer.
    It might be the original question or not.
    Sometimes not even close—nobody knows until the end of the game.
    The sheet is folded again and the next player has to answer the new question—without knowing the previous questions and answers.""")}
